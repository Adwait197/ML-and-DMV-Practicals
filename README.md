# ML-and-DMV-Practicals
This GitHub repository contains a collection of assignments and projects focusing on Machine Learning (ML) and Data Modelling and Visualization (DMV). These assignments are designed to provide hands-on experience with key concepts and practical applications in these domains.

Machine Learning Assignments:

Introduction to ML: Basic ML algorithms implementation.
Supervised Learning Projects: Applications of regression and classification algorithms.
Unsupervised Learning Tasks: Clustering and dimensionality reduction exercises.

Data Modelling and Visualization Projects:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Techniques for understanding and visualizing datasets.
Association Rule Mining: Extracting valuable patterns from large datasets.
Interactive Data Visualization: Using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective data representation.

How to Use:

Each assignment is contained in a separate folder with detailed instructions and starter code. Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance your ML and DMV skills through these hands-on assignments.
